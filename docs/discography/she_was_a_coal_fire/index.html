				<h7>Most of these songs were written in my sophomore year dorm room at UCLA in 2018-19. The guitar in the recordings was likely recorded in the dorm or at my parents house over the years following. Overdubbing various layers including synths, drums, and percussion was a lengthy process that never really finished. My brother Joey contributed some catchy synth line overdubs at some point in 2020 during the pandemic, and fellow Horse Friend Julia added some electronic drums and samples. Joey’s synth is on Tracks 16 and 20, and Julia’s percussion is on Tracks 2 and 3. Most of the live drumming was performed by me but some was done by Lucas Moore, who helped me engineer the drum overdubbing sessions in their bus in the Mojave desert in 2021.
				<br> <br>
				I grew so tired of these songs over the few years it took me to prep them for upload. The state I posted them in is not one I am happy with either, it pretty much signifies an abandonment of the project. This comes with varying remorse for different tracks. The strongest songs I have continued to work on and perfect, and I have since found pride in their growth from the time of the Coal Fire recordings. I really should have started redoing them long ago, the original dorm/home recordings were really nothing special. I just hate redoing. For other tracks like the interludes, I have also grown to accept their position in an album labelled “demos.” They are really only sketches anyway, in the style of the rest of the project, and I think they sound as good as I could make them now.
				<br> <br>
				It’s really the drumming and subsequent mixing that threw a wrench in this project, as well as my lack of confidence with singing. It’s hard to get home production to sound like your favorite band. But the learning never stops! Some of these songs will see the light of day again some day, and at the time of writing of this annotation (11/1/2022), this redo is a work-in-progress, and one I am proud of.
				<br> <br>
				Even though the recordings were done all across space and time this album definitely captures the remnants of some dorm room angst. Beyond that I am happy to say that they also bridge the gap between the stuff I recorded as a “kid” and the stuff I dream of making now.</h7>
