		<h2>Each of these tracks represents some different lesson in undergraduate music theory or musicianship. Most pretty strictly adhered to the assignment guidelines but some bore little resemblance to what my teachers might have imagined.
		<br> <br>
		Track 1 is just a typical 12-bar blues with a C Jam Blues inspired melody. Track 2 is synth noise for some silly modal assignment. Track 3 is a version of Hedonist Quiz from She Was A Coal Fire… that I turned in (with some extra percussion) for a polyrhythm assignment. Tracks 4 and 5 were made for some sort of open-ended assignment. Track 6, which features my brother Joey playing a second guitar, was my submission for a hocketing assignment. Track 7 was a final project for a class on experimental composition. Track 8 was recorded much later than the others and was performed in response to my girlfriend, Valentina’s assignment in a music class to “respond” to a studied composition, for which she chose “All Blues” by Miles Davis. I played my SP-404 and she played the trumpet.</h2>
